# USE LYDIAâ€™S PSD2 CBPII APIs

As a Third Party Provider (TPP), you delivered to a customer a private labeled payment card linked to his bank account. The customer (PSU) is performing a transaction on an e-commerce site with it. The customer has previously given consent to your entity as well as to his bank account holder.
Using API "CPBII" setup by banks (ASPSP), you can request for real-time transaction amount coverage data authorized by the customer without asking for online banking credentials. You can then reduce your risk for overdue payments.
The bank will respond yes or no without any funds blockage corresponding to the transaction amount, neither any validation of this transaction.

To access our CBPII API, TPP should act with the Card Based Payment Instrument Issuer (CBPII) role.

And the Payment Service User (PSU), owner of the accounts held by Lydia, should give accreditations to the TPP in order to receive a confirmation of funds availability on the PSU account.

## PSU consent
Lydia chose the Mixed Model so Lydia requires the formal consent of the PSU. 
The API is designed on a REST FULL model using JSON Structures. Our API is based on STET (1.6.3) format.
Lydia will identify and authorize the customer using the "redirect" mode in order to issue the tokens.

### Prerequisites
- TPP has an agreement for the AISP role from any european competent authority
- TPP and PSU have service contract
- TPP and Lydia have been performed a mutual authentication
- TPP has delivered his OAUTH2 access token to be able to consume the API resources

### CBPII authorization flow

#### PSU consent page redirection
> Request
```
GET https://openauth.lydia-app.com/authorization/login
    ?client_id=65904271c7f48ee638a684f55f76a92a1c7ecc7a0c56e5c0a1b83e2510efcb4d
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftpp.com
    &state=123456
    &scope=cbpii
```
Notes:
- Client id has been provided to you by Lydia during your onboarding.
- Redirect URI must have been registered during your onboarding.
- If provided, `state` will be forwarded to you as query parameter of you redirect uri.
- You can ask for more scopes in the same request, refer to the OpenAPI documentation.
